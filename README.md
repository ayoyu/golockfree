# Go Lock Free

## Overview

The goal of this project is to implement and learn about different known lock-free algorithms from different academic research papers (the papers will be cited in the citation section) and **benchmark** them with the usual locked mutex data structures. The benchmarking will try to cover several toy and real-world workload scenarios to have a rich comparison.

Because of the usage of Generics and some new helpers from the atomic package, the minimal supported Golang version is 1.19.
